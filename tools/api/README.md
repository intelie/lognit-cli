#Lognit REST API

#Introduction

The pages here briefly shows some examples of usage for Lognit REST API.

Although you can call it from the browser or via cURL directly, you may find
annoying to pass credentials on every call. We provide a way to reuse the nit
currently logged session into curl calls. It is called nitr. You may find
further info [here](nitr.md).
